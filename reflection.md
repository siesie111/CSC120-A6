What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?
What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Unit testing allow me to test the methods I wrote. It works especially well when the error is not coding error but logical error. 

I implemented assertTrue (check whether the boolean of value from the class return true), assertFalse(check whether the boolean of value from the class return false), assertEquals(check whether the expected value is equal to the value generated by the class), assertNotNull(check whether the class not returns null), and assertNull(check whether the class returns null). 

I am more familiar with the usage of assert true, false, equals since they are more frequently use. The difficult part is relating the methods I wrote in different classes, since I will need to check for different methods and create object that enables me to check them using the unit testing methods. The advice will be get familair with the original A4 assingment you wrote before starting this assginment, because we will need to refer back to that content and recall what we were doing two weeks ago throughout this assingment.
